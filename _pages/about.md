I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow working in the [Gomez Geodynamics Research Group](https://www.natalyagomez.com "Geodynamics Research Group") 
at McGill University. In my research, I use a combination of geophysical field
observations and model-based methods to advance our understanding of the solid Earth,
the cryosphere, and the wide range of interactions that occur between these two systems
in polar regions. 

My current work builds on my doctoral research, where I employed several seismological methods 
and datasets to image crustal and upper mantle structure across a range of spatial scales 
(i.e., local, regional, continental) in Antarctica. Specifically, I am presently 
incorporating heterogenous solid Earth structure that I imaged at the glacial basin and 
sub-basin scales during my Ph.D. into 3D glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models.

Along with my work focused on solid Earth - ice sheet interaction, I also use 
glacial seismicity as a means to investigate the dynamics of cryospheric processes occurring at both the ice – ocean and ice – bedrock interfaces. 


# News
**November - December 2023**: In the field in West Antarctica to service and collect data from 
Polar Earth Observing Network (POLENET) seismic and GPS sites. We worked out of Union Glacier Camp, 
located in the Ellsworth Mountains, this season. Check out this great 
[blog](https://polenet.org/2023-2024-field-season-progress/) (with many many pictures) about our field season!
