I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow working in the [Gomez Geodynamics Research Group](https://www.natalyagomez.com "Geodynamics Research Group") 
at McGill University. In my research, I use a combination of geophysical field
observations and model-based methods to advance our understanding of the solid Earth,
the cryosphere, and the wide range of interactions that occur between these two systems
in polar regions. 

My current work builds on my doctoral research, where I employed several seismological methods 
and datasets to image crustal and upper mantle structure across a range of spatial scales 
(i.e., local, regional, continental) in Antarctica. Specifically, I am presently 
incorporating heterogenous solid Earth structure that I imaged at the glacial basin and 
sub-basin scales during my Ph.D. into 3D glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models.

**November - December 2023**: In West Antarctica to service and collect data from Polar Earth Observing Network (POLENET) seismic 
and GPS sites. We worked out of Union Glacier Camp, located in the Ellsworth Mountains, this season. Check out this great 
[blog](https://polenet.org/2023-2024-field-season-progress/) about our field season.
