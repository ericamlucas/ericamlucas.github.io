I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow working in Natalya Gomez's 
[Geodynamics Research Group](https://www.natalyagomez.com "Geodynamics Research Group") 
at McGill University. I use a combination of geophysical field observations and model-based 
methods to advance our understanding of the solid Earth, the cryosphere, and the wide 
range of interactions that occur between these two systems in polar regions. My current 
research builds on my doctoral research, where I employed several seismological methods 
and datasets to image crustal and upper mantle structure across a range of spatial scales 
(i.e., local, regional, continental) in Antarctica. Specifically, I am presently 
incorporating heterogenous solid Earth structure that I imaged at the glacial basin and 
sub-basin scales during my Ph.D. into solid Earth â€“ ice sheet models.
