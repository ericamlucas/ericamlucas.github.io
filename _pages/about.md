I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow working in the [Gomez Geodynamics Research Group](https://www.natalyagomez.com "Geodynamics Research Group") 
at McGill University. In my research, I use a combination of geophysical field
observations and model-based methods to advance our understanding of the solid Earth,
the cryosphere, and the wide range of interactions that occur between these two systems
in polar regions. 

My current work builds on my doctoral research, where I employed several seismological methods
to image solid Earth structure across a range of spatial scales (i.e., local, regional, continental) in Antarctica.
Specifically, I am presently incorporating heterogenous solid Earth structure that I imaged at the glacial basin and 
sub-basin scales during my PhD into 3D glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models.

Along with my work focused on solid Earth - ice sheet interactions, I also use 
glacial seismicity as a means to investigate the dynamics of cryospheric processes occurring at both the ice – ocean and ice – bedrock interfaces. 


# News
**November - December 2023**: In West Antarctica to service and collect data from Polar Earth Observing Network (POLENET) seismic and GPS sites. 
The POLENET field team worked out of Union Glacier Camp, located in the Ellsworth Mountains, this season. Check out this great 
[blog](https://polenet.org/2023-2024-field-season-progress/) (with many many pictures) about our field season!
