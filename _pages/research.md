# Solid Earth - Ice Sheet interactions 
![image-right](/images/cryosphere2.jpg){: .align-right} I am presently incorporating heterogenous solid Earth structure that I imaged at the glacial basin and sub-basin scales during my Ph.D. into solid Earth â€“ ice sheet models. 
An overarching goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of glacial isostatic adjustment to heterogeneity in solid Earth structure. With a focus on better constraining interactions 
between the solid Earth and ice sheets, my work has direct implications for improving the accuracy of global sea level projections in a changing climate. 


# Seismic imaging of solid Earth structure in polar regions 
I have employed several seismological methods and datasets to image crustal and upper mantle structure across a range of spatial scales (i.e., local, regional, continental) in Antarctica.
This work has had implications for better understanding the origin and development of sub-continental tectonic features, such as the West Antarctic 
Rift System and Marie Byrd Land dome.

# Glacial seismicity 
I am interested in studying glacial seismicity to better understand processes occurring at the ice-ocean and ice-bedrock interfaces.

Tidally modulated glacial seismicity at the Foundation Ice Stream - icequakes primarily occur during rising tide preceding daily high tide (Lucas et al. 2023)
