# Solid Earth - Ice Sheet interactions 
I am presently incorporating heterogenous solid Earth structure that I imaged at the glacial basin and sub-basin scales during my Ph.D. into solid Earth â€“ ice sheet models. 
An overarching goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of GIA to heterogeneity in solid Earth structure. With a focus on better constraining interactions 
between the solid Earth and ice sheets, my work has direct implications for improving the accuracy of global sea level projections in a changing climate.

# Seismic imaging of solid Earth structure in polar regions 
I have employed several seismological methods and datasets to image crustal and upper mantle structure across a range of spatial scales (i.e., local, regional, continental) in Antarctica.
This work has had implications for better understanding the origin and development of sub-continental tectonic features, such as the West Antarctic 
Rift System and Marie Byrd Land dome.

# Glacial seismicity 
Glacial seismicity to better understand glaciologic processes occurring at the ice-ocean and ice-bedrock interfaces. 
Studying glacial seismicity can provide important insight into the dynamics of glacier flow, fracture, and discharge into the ocean.
